Cognitive Load

What are the parameters we would be considering?
Heart rate for now

We will be using measuring heart rate and then calculate r-r intervals as well for Heart rate variablilty

Eye tracker

With Eye tracker, we will be focusing on eye fixations and saccades (which are nothing but rapid eye movements. How we will be doing that:

1. Define Regions of Interest (ROIs):
   - Identify specific areas of interest within the simulation interface relevant to drone operation tasks. These could include controls, navigation indicators, or obstacles.
   - Segment the simulation screen into distinct ROIs based on the functional elements of the interface.

2. Eye Fixation Analysis:
   - Track the participant's eye movements and identify fixations, which are periods of stable gaze within an ROI.
   - Analyze the duration and frequency of fixations within different ROIs.
   - Longer fixation durations within critical ROIs may indicate increased cognitive processing or decision-making in those areas.
   - Compare fixation patterns across different simulation scenarios or difficulty levels to assess cognitive load variations.

3. Saccade Frequency Analysis:
   - Saccades are rapid eye movements between fixations, reflecting shifts in attention.
   - Calculate the frequency of saccades between ROIs or within specific regions.
   - Higher saccade frequencies may indicate increased visual scanning and attentional demands as the participant navigates the simulation interface.
   - Analyze how saccade frequency correlates with task complexity or workload levels.

4. Interpretation and Insights:
   - Examine how fixation patterns and saccade frequencies change over time or in response to task demands.
   - Identify periods of increased cognitive load based on prolonged fixations or rapid shifts in attention (high saccade frequency) during challenging simulation tasks.
   - Compare eye movement metrics with concurrent physiological measures such as heart rate to understand the relationship between cognitive workload and physiological arousal.
   - Use subjective ratings or cognitive load models to validate findings and gain a comprehensive understanding of the participant's mental state during the simulation.

5. Visualization and Reporting:
   - Present eye tracking data using visualizations such as heatmaps or gaze plots to illustrate areas of focus and attentional shifts.
   - Include quantitative measures of fixation duration and saccade frequency in your analysis reports.
   - Highlight key findings related to cognitive load, attention allocation, and task performance, providing insights into the effectiveness of the simulation interface or training program.
